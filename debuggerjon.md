Outside the detective’s office.

Narration : I’m debugger Jon. The world’s #1 debugger. People come everyday in my office to help them solve cases in the metaverse.

A guy abruptly enters Jon’s office.

This guy : Sir, I need your help.

Debugger Jon : Let’s talk. Want some tea?

The guy and Jon are seated next to each other discussing the case at hand around some tea.

Narration : The case was simple. Jeremy owned a restaurant on Matrix street where he was accustomed to receiving food deliveries from his providers. The problem was that once delivered and put in the storage room a large quantity would mysteriously disappear. 

Jeremy wanted me to find the culprit because it was starting to threaten the business’ bottom line as he would struggle to feed all his customers for the day.

Jon enters the restaurant with a bag.

Jon : Hi, I’m debugger Jon.

Servant : Our CEO is expecting you. Come over to the kitchen.

Jon follows the servant to the kitchen.

Jeremy : Hey, you’re 10 minutes late!

Jon : Taking my time is part of the process after all you’re hiring the #1…

Jeremy interrupts : Yeah, yeah I know. Now do your thing.

Jon sit in the kitchen table, pulls out his laptop and mouse from his bag. He then starts using his computer.

Jeremy who is next to him is perplexed.

Jeremy : What are you doing! Get to work! I’m paying you 3000 meta coins an hour!

Jon : This, IS work.

Jeremy : Huh, but you're sitting at your computer, how are you going to find out how the food is disappearing.

Jon : Come here, look at the screen.

Jeremy : What is this gibberish (looking at the code on Jon’s screen).

Jon : This is your restaurant's code base. In here we have a couple of files. The file that I just opened is the code for the kitchen we’re currently in. 

Jeremy : How do you have access to this? What does it mean?

Jon : Remember our discussion in the office when I asked you for your restaurant’s keys. They contain a password that grants me access to the code that allows your restaurant to exist in the metaverse.

Jeremy : Mamamia!

Jon : What’s even cooler is that I can make stuff happen in your restaurant. For example, You see the tomatoes here.

(Jon types something in his computer and the tomatoes disappear).

Jeremy : Wicked! Ahum… I mean Mamamia! How did you do that!

Jon : I deleted the code representing the tomatoes in your restaurant’s code base. This relation between the code and the metaverse is what allows me to do my job as the #1 debugger.
Jon : Now, I’m going to open the file related to the storage room and investigate how the food disappears.

Jeremy : How much time is this going to take?

Jon : I should at least get some clues today. What I recommend is that you continue running the restaurant as if I’m not here. When I’ll find something I’ll call you back here. Ok?

Jeremy :  Ok.

Jon : The first step is to place some console.logs in the entrance of each of the restaurant’s rooms. This method is called print debugging and allows me to see everything that passes in and outside those rooms.
 
2 hours later.

Jon : Humm there is…nothing suspicious. The food is only going from the storage room to the kitchen.

At the end of the day.

Jeremy comes to see Jon in the kitchen.

Jeremy : So…did you solve the case?

Jon : I don’t understand the food is being consumed normally.

Jeremy : Ughh… I knew it was a mistake to hire you. I guess I’ll ask the city’s mayor to give me some money as part of the small business damage refund program.

Jon : You’re sure that the food is disappearing? How are you going to prove that you qualify for this “refund”?

Jeremy : I did all the paperwork already. The last step was to hire a debugger to confirm that this is a lost cause. Now will you sign this so I can prove that I hired and give you your money.

Jon : Uhmm… I still think I can solve the case.

Jeremy : Just sign!

Jon : Ok fair enough.

Jon is going back to his office depressed.
Jon is now on his desk pondering on what just happened.

Jon thinks : I guess I’m not the #1 I thought I was. But come on, there was no problem when I inspected the code. How could the food mysteriously disappear while none of it disappeared today.

Jon opens up his computer and remembers that he still has access to the restaurant’s code base.

Jon : I forgot to tell Jeremy to change the key code for the restaurant’s code base. Maybe he already did.

Jon tries to access the code base and he’s able to.

Jon : No way… NO WAY! I have access to everything.

Jon notices that someone else is modifying the code right now.

Jon : Who is this guy? Wait…, he’s the one deleting part of the food stock.

Jon copies his ID on another tab and gets detailed information on the person.

Jon : I think we have our culprit.
Narration : I was able to pin down the guy and make him spit out why he was doing what he was doing. It turned out that Jeremy hired him and gave him access to the code base. This amateur couldn’t even hide his own ID before doing his misdeeds. He would simply change the location of the food when the inspector was visiting. When an inspector was in the storage room the food was put programmatically in the kitchen. When the inspector went to the kitchen the food was put back in the storage room.


Town Hall

Jon : Jeremy! I caught the culprit and he told me everything! You’re under arrest!
